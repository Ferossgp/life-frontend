# Life frontend

This project will be frontend for some API which provides information about life
quality in different countries and cities. 
Some API to be used:
1. http://api.population.io
2. https://developers.teleport.org/api/


# Expected Result
I will create an auto complete search and based on different input search a page with graphs and
different facts will be rendered. Also I will try to make it more interactive and to organize
information specially for a specific user.
